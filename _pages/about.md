The [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) Lab for Interfacial Dynamics (UCLID) is an interdisciplinary laboratory with experimental and computational capabilities to explore transport mechanics at curved liquid-vapor interfaces such as drops, bubbles, sprays, etc. At UCLID, we study liquid-vapor phase change at a fundamental level using **theory**, _on-earth_ and _in-space_ **experiments**, and computational **modeling**. We then leverage the knowledge gained to pioneer next generation microscale phase change transfer devices, enable new technologies for the upcoming hydrogen economy, develop solutions for thermo-fluid management in microgravity and address critical issues in the food-water-energy nexus and enable breakthroughs in advanced manufacturing.
