The [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) Lab for Interfacial Dynamics (UCLID) is an interdisciplinary laboratory with experimental and computational capabilities to explore transport mechanics at curved liquid-vapor interfaces such as drops, bubbles, sprays, etc. At UCLID, we study liquid-vapor phase change at a fundamental level using **theory**, _on-earth_ and _in-space_ **experiments**, and computational **modeling**. We then leverage the knowledge gained to pioneer next generation microscale phase change transfer devices, enable new technologies for the upcoming hydrogen economy, develop solutions for thermo-fluid management in microgravity and address critical issues in the food-water-energy nexus and enable breakthroughs in advanced manufacturing.

<!---Hi! I'm an engineer by profession, researcher by curiosity and educator by passion. I'm currently an assistant professor in [Mechanical and Materials Engineering](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/mechanical-materials-engineering.html) at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/). --->


<!---Background
------ 
Liquid-vapor phase change is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered devices. It’s happening around us – all the time. The cup of coffee, the tree outdoor, the AC unit indoor, they are all undergoing “evaporation” in some form. Curved surfaces (such as droplets and bubbles) exhibit unique properties due to surface tension that alters evaporation. In turn, the evaporation further deforms and moves the interface. At UCLID, we focus on liquid-vapor phase change and associated interfacial dynamics. We study multi-phase transport phenomena using a combination of visualization tools, theory, and modeling. We work on a variety of topics including but not limited to boiling, condensation, dehumidification, evaporative deposition, colloidal self-assembly, porous media transport, electronics cooling, cryogenics, variable-gravity fluid management, and nano-/micro-scale heat transfer.

<!--- Bio
------
I recieved a BS in Mechanical Engineering from [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu/) in 2013. I then briefly worked as a hydraulics engineer at The Raymond Corp. in Greene, NY. It only took me a few months to realize grad school is where I belonged. I graduated with an MS in 2016 and a PhD in August 2018, both from [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/).

[]: Interests
------
My research is mainly focused on liquid-vapor phase change (evaporation/condensation) and associated interfacial phenomena. My specific interests include micro-scale thermophysics, capillary phenomena, heat and mass transfer, cryogenics, optical characterization, computational fluid dynamics, data driven modeling, scientific and high performance computing. In short, if theres a liquid-vapor mixture that's either small, cold or in space - I'm interested in it!

Although most of my work is computational in nature, my unique interests have led me to use / develop novel characterization tools (neutron imaging, interferometry, SANS, SPR microscopy and ellipsometry) to validate models and explore different aspects of my research intersts. I'm currently working on multiple projects on fundamental liquid-vapor phase change both on earth and on the International Space Station. Want to learn more? Explore the different tabs on this website or send me an <a href="mailto:bellurkn@ucmail.uc.edu">email</a>.

I would love to collaborate with anyone interested in any of the above topics. I'm also passionate about teaching emphasizing on "hands-on" active learning, data analysis and communication and integrated thermo-fluid-sciences. 

In my spare time, I like to sample new cuisines, test new recipes and explore the outdoors by any self propelled means possible - walk, bike, ski or run.
