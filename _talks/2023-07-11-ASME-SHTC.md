The cryo-neutron dataset was used in conjunction with our multiscale evaporation model to show that the interface is non-isothermal. Most studies in the past have assumed an isothermal interface based on equilibrium arguements leading to the discrepency in reported values. We show that accounting for non-uniformity in temperature and pressure results in a predictable coefficient.
