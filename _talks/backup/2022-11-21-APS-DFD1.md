Exerimental results from cryo/neutron imaging work were discussed. The data (neutron images, temperature and pressure measurements) were packed into a publicly accessible [database](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/z5zc7kk76g/2) and disseminated through a [data article](https://kishanbellur.github.io/publication/bellur_2022a).
