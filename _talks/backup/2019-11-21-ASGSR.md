The complete cryo-neutron story is presented in an integrated modular approach. The experiments, thermal transport analysis and multi-scale evaporation modeling are combined to generate the accommodation coefficients for both hydrogen and methane. The resulting values are independent of both container material and size and agree well with a fluid independent transition state theory prediction.
