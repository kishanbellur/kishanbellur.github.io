The presentation focused on the development of a new experimental method to determine accommodation coefficients. The ability to visualize liquid hydrogen was emphasized The presentation resulted in a [journal article](http://kishanbellur.github.io/files/bellur_2016.pdf) published in [Cryogenics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cryogenics)
