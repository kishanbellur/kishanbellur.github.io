  abstract = {A fundamental understanding of the evaporation/condensation phenomena is vital to many fields of science and engineering, yet there is many discrepancies in the usage of phase-change models and associated coefficients. First, a brief review of the kinetic theory of phase change is provided, and the mass accommodation coefficient (MAC, {$\alpha$}) and its inconsistent definitions are discussed. The discussion focuses on the departure from equilibrium; represented as a macroscopic ``drift'' velocity. Then, a continuous flow, phase change driven molecular-dynamics setup is used to investigate steady-state condensation at a flat liquid-vapor interface of argon at various phase-change rates and temperatures to elucidate the effect of equilibrium departure. MAC is computed directly from the kinetic theory-based Hertz--Knudsen (H-K) and Schrage (exact and approximate) expressions without the need for a priori physical definitions, ad-hoc particle injection/removal, or particle counting. MAC values determined from the approximate and exact Schrage expressions ({$\alpha$}appSchrage and {$\alpha$}exactSchrage) are between 0.8 and 0.9, while MAC values from the H-K expression ({$\alpha$}H-K) are above unity for all cases tested. {$\alpha$}exactSchrage yield value closest to the results from transition state theory [J Chem Phys, 118, 1392--1399 (2003)]. The departure from equilibrium does not affect the value of {$\alpha$}exactSchrage but causes {$\alpha$}H-K to vary drastically emphasizing the importance of a drift velocity correction. Additionally, equilibrium departure causes a nonuniform distribution in vapor properties. At the condensing interface, a local rise in vapor temperature and a drop in vapor density is observed when compared with the corresponding bulk values. When the deviation from bulk values are taken into account, all values of MAC including {$\alpha$}exactSchrage show a small yet noticeable difference that is both temperature and phase-change rate dependent.},

  abstract = {Passive and active technologies have been used to control propellant boil-off, but the current state of understanding of cryogenic evaporation and condensation in microgravity is insufficient for designing large cryogenic depots critical to the long-term space exploration missions. One of the key factors limiting the ability to design such systems is the uncertainty in the accommodation coefficients (evaporation and condensation), which are inputs for kinetic modeling of phase change. A novel, combined experimental and computational approach is being used to determine the accommodation coefficients for liquid hydrogen and liquid methane. The experimental effort utilizes the Neutron Imaging Facility located at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland to image evaporation and condensation of hydrogenated propellants inside of metallic containers. The computational effort includes numerical solution of a model for phase change in the contact line and thin film regions as well as an CFD effort for determining the appropriate thermal boundary conditions for the numerical solution of the evaporating and condensing liquid. Using all three methods, there is the possibility of extracting the accommodation coefficients from the experimental observations. The experiments are the first known observation of a liquid hydrogen menisci condensing and evaporating inside aluminum and stainless steel cylinders. The experimental technique, complimentary computational thermal model and meniscus shape determination are reported. The computational thermal model has been shown to accurately track the transient thermal response of the test cells. The meniscus shape determination suggests the presence of a finite contact angle, albeit very small, between liquid hydrogen and aluminum oxide.},

  abstract = {Control of boil-off of cryogenic propellants is a continuing technical challenge for long duration space missions. Predicting phase change rates of cryogenic liquids requires an accurate estimation of solid-fluid interface temperature distributions in regions where a contact line or a thin liquid film exists. This paper described a methodology to predict inner wall temperature gradients with and without evaporation using discrete temperature measurements on the outer wall of a container. Phase change experiments with liquid hydrogen and methane in cylindrical test cells of various materials and sizes were conducted at the Neutron Imaging Facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Two types of tests were conducted. The first type of testing involved thermal cycling of an evacuated cell (dry) and the second involved controlled phase change with cryogenic liquids (wet). During both types of tests, temperatures were measured using Si-diode sensors mounted on the exterior surface of the test cells. Heat is transferred to the test cell by conduction through a helium exchange gas and through the cryostat sample holder. Thermal conduction through the sample holder is shown to be the dominant mode with the rate of heat transfer limited by six independent contact resistances. An iterative methodology is employed to determine contact resistances between the various components of the cryostat stick insert, test cell and lid using the dry test data. After the contact resistances are established, inner wall temperature distributions during wet tests are calculated.},

  abstract = {Evaporation along a curved liquid vapor interface, such as that of a wetting meniscus, is a classic multiscale problem of vital significance to many fields of science and engineering. However, a complete description of the local evaporative flux over all length scales, especially without arbitrary tuning of boundary conditions, is lacking. A multiscale method to model evaporation from steady meniscus is described such that a need for tuning of boundary conditions and additional assumptions are alleviated. A meniscus submodel is used to compute evaporation flux in the bulk meniscus while a transition film submodel is used to account for enhanced evaporation near the contact line. A unique coupling between the meniscus and transition film submodels ensures smooth continuity of both film and mass flux profiles along the meniscus. The local mass flux is then integrated over the interfacial area to investigate the contribution from the different regions on the surface. The model is evaluated with data from cryoneutron phase-change tests conducted previously at National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) [K. Bellur et al., Cryogenics 74, 131 (2016)]. It is found that the peak mass flux in the transition region is two orders of magnitude greater than the flux at the apex. Despite the enhanced evaporation in the thin film region, it was found that 78--95\% of the evaporation occurs in the bulk meniscus due to the large area. The bulk meniscus contribution increases with increase in vapor pressure and Bond number but decreases with an increase in thermal conductivity of the substrate. Using a nonuniform temperature boundary suggests that there is a possibility that the adsorbed film may have a nonzero mass flux.},

The current understanding of cryogenic phase change and subsequent boil-off is limited, in part, because the values of accommodation coefficients (inputs to phase change models) are still lacking and experimental data to compute them are severely limited. In order to determine the accommodation coefficients, a new cryo/neutron imaging experiment was developed. Tests were conducted in the BT-2 Neutron Imaging Facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by introducing propellant vapor into cylindrical aluminum (Al 6061) and stainless steel (SS 316) cells placed inside a 70 mm cryostat. Saturation points between 80 kPa - 230 kPa were tested for liquid H2 and CH4. Phase change was induced through precise control of pressure and/or temperature. Neutron imaging was used to visualize the liquid and evaporation/condensation rates were determined through image processing. Both hydrogen and methane are perfectly wetting fluids as evidenced by the formation of micro-scale thin film at the onset of condensation and varies in thickness with rate of phase change. The rates of phase change are a function of both the size of the container and the degree of offset from saturation. The unique experimental data, made available through a data repository, have the potential to serve as a bench mark for future studies or serve as a dataset for model validation.},

These discrepancies have been attributed to a wall material or geometric dependency resulting in the need for an empirical correction factors. The lack of experimental results for cryogenic fluids poses a serious impediment to modeling/predicting propellant behavior for long term space missions. Using a combination of neutron imaging experiments and multi-scale modeling, mass accommodation coefficients for liquid hydrogen and methane are determined. When the local variation in thermophysical properties are accounted for, the experimentally derived accommodation coefficients for hydrogen are invariant to container size, material and evaporation rate. The discrepancy in prior measurements of the accommodation coefficient for other fluids might be alleviated by a multi-scale analysis that incorporates local variation in thermophysical properties. The values of accommodation coefficients for hydrogen and methane are consistent with generalized transition state theory. This suggests that a mass accommodation coefficient is a solely a function of the liquid-vapor density ratio, making it a fluid-independent property easily determined without the need for empirical correction factors as reported in previous investigations.},

  abstract = {Kinetic models of liquid-vapor phase change often implicitly assume that the interface is in equilibrium. This equilibrium assumption can be justified for large flat interfaces far from the source of thermal energy, but it breaks down when the liquid surface is near a solid wall, or there is significant interface curvature. The Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) experiments conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) provide a unique opportunity to probe this common assumption and also provide unique data and insight into phase change-driven flow physics. The CVB experiment consists of a quartz cuvette partially filled with pentane such that a vapor bubble is formed at the center. The setup is heated and cooled at opposite ends, resulting in simultaneous evaporation and condensation. CVB data from the NASA Physical Science Informatics (PSI) database was used to reconstruct the entire 3D interface shape using interferometric image analysis and obtain an estimate of the net heat input to the bubble. The reconstructed interface shape is used to develop a liquid-only CFD model embedded with a custom-built ``active surface'' method that sets a variable interfacial temperature/phase change flux boundary condition. Phase change flux varies in both the axial and transverse directions, leading to a small ({$\sim$}1~K) but discernible temperature variation along the liquid-vapor interface. The positive phase change flux near the heater end (denoting evaporation) gradually reduces and becomes negative near the cooler end (denoting condensation), resulting in an axial bulk flow of liquid from the cold to the hot end. There is also a higher flux in the thin film as opposed to the thick film, resulting in a transverse bulk flow. However, the interfacial temperature gradients along both axial and transverse directions induce a separate thermocapillary flow in a direction opposite to the bulk flows, leading to complex ``wavy'' flows with recirculation. A qualitative analysis of the flow pattern is presented in this paper and correlated with optical signatures from experimental images.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of bubble growth is crucial to modeling boiling heat transfer and enabling the development of technological applications, such as energy systems and thermal management processes, which rely on boiling to achieve the high heat fluxes required for their operation. This paper presents analyses of the evaporation of ``microlayers'', i.e., ultra-thin layers of liquid present beneath steam bubbles growing at the heated surface in the atmospheric pressure nucleate of boiling water. Evaporation of the microlayer is believed to be a major contributor to the phase change heat transfer, but its evolution, spatio-temporal stability, and impact on macroscale bubble dynamics are still poorly understood. Mass, momentum, and energy transfer in the microlayer are modeled with a lubrication theory approach that accounts for capillary and intermolecular forces and interfacial mass transfer. The model is embodied in a third-order nonlinear film evolution equation, which is solved numerically. Variable wall-temperature boundary conditions are applied at the solid--liquid interface to account for conjugate heat transfer due to evaporative heat loss at the liquid--vapor interface. Predictions obtained with the current approach compare favorably with experimental measurements of microlayer evaporation. By comparing film profiles at a sequence of times into the ebullition cycle of a single bubble, likely values of evaporative heat transfer coefficients were inferred and found to fall within the range of previously reported estimates. The result suggests that the coefficients may not be a constant, as previously assumed, but instead something that varies with time during the ebullition cycle.},

  abstract = {As online educational experiences have become more common for students to engage with while earning an engineering degree, instructors must become more attuned to best practices in digital pedagogies for all courses, including those with heavy laboratory components. Despite potential resistance among faculty to the idea that a laboratory course does not require an in-person experience, pandemic-driven remote learning serves as an intrinsic data point in how, under dire circumstances, laboratory courses could be offered through a digital medium. This paper describes a collaborative autoethnography of four mechanical and aerospace engineering instructors regarding lessons learned while teaching laboratory courses online during the COVID-19 pandemic. To bolster the quality of the research design, an engineering education researcher facilitated the collaborative autoethnography and co-constructed the individual instructor narratives to elicit best practices in online pedagogy for turbomachinery educators.},

  abstract = {Although the 46800-type Li-ion batteries have superior attributes, including high driving range, energy density, and fast charging capability, it is plagued by higher heat generation during discharge impacting performance, efficiency, and lifespan. To address this problem, a novel thermal management system is proposed utilizing direct/indirect liquid cooling with water, CuO nanofluid, and HFE-7100. Meshed separator plates are developed in the direct cooling channel to improve thermal uniformity and mitigate hot spots on LIBs. The numerical evaluation considers effects such as C-rate, coolant, separator wall, flow rates, flow direction, and ambient temperature on the thermal performance of the LIB pack. During a 3C discharge operation, compared to 1C, the LIB pack experiences a 7~{$^\circ$}C increase in maximum temperature and a 4.1~{$^\circ$}C temperature difference. However, with a 4\% CuO nanofluid, these values decrease by 4.9~{$^\circ$}C and 3~{$^\circ$}C respectively, compared to water. A circular meshed separator wall improved the thermal performance of the battery pack by 22.7\% compared to the non-wall condition. The inflow velocities of the direct and indirect cooling channels are increased from 0.2 to 0.3~m/s and from 0.1 to 0.2~m/s, respectively, which led to the 11.5\% enhancement of the LIB pack's thermal efficiency. Finally, the thermal performance of the proposed cooling system is assessed by considering various ambient temperatures ranging from 25~{$^\circ$}C to 40~{$^\circ$}C for the LIB pack. The results indicated that the optimized cooling system can maintain the maximum temperature of the LIB pack below 40~{$^\circ$}C, even at an ambient temperature of 35~{$^\circ$}C.},

  abstract = {Miniaturization of multifunctional instruments is key to evolving less invasive medical procedures. The current work outlines steps towards developing a miniature motor to power a cutting tool of a millimeter-scale robot/device (target outside diameter {\textasciitilde}2 mm) for minimally invasive procedures. Multiple motor concepts were explored and ranked using a Pugh matrix. The single-rotor hydraulic design was deemed most viable for prototyping and scale-down to the target size. Prototypes were manufactured to be progressively smaller using additive manufacturing. The smallest prototype fabricated was 2:1 scale of the desired final size with a 2 mm outside diameter (OD) rotor and a device OD of 4 mm. The scaled prototypes with an 8 mm rotor were lab tested and achieved average speeds of 5000--6000 RPM at a flowrate of 15--18 mL/s and 45 PSI water pressure. Ansys CFX was used as a design tool to explore the parameter space and 3D transient simulations were implemented using the immersed solid method. The predicted rotor RPM from the modeling matched the experimental values within 3\% error. The model was then used to develop performance curves for the miniature hydraulic motor. In summary, the single-rotor hydraulic design shows promise for miniaturization to the target 2 mm size.},

  abstract = {Aligned with the medical device industry's trend of miniaturization, academic and commercial researchers are constantly attempting to reduce device sizes. Many applications require miniature actuators (2 mm range) to perform mechanical work; however, biocompatible micromotors are not readily available. To that end, a hydraulic motor-driven cutting module that aims to combine cutting and drug delivery is presented. The hydraulic motor prototype developed has an outside diameter (OD) of {\textasciitilde}4 mm (twice the target size) and a 1 mm drive shaft to attach a cutter. Four different designs were explored and fabricated using additive manufacturing. The benchtop experimental data of the prototypes are presented herein. For the prototype motor with fluid inlet perpendicular to the blades, the average angular velocity was 10,593 RPM at a flowrate of 3.6 mL/s and 42,597 RPM at 10.1 mL/s. This design was numerically modeled using 3D-transient simulations in ANSYS CFX (version 2022 R2) to determine the performance characteristics and the internal resistance of the motor. Simplified mathematical models were also used to compute and compare the peak torque with the simulation estimates. The viability of current design represents a crucial milestone in scaling the hydraulic motor to a 2 mm OD to power a microcutter.},
